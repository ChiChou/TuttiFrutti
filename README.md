I've always wanted to build something like James Forshaw did or SysterInternals Suite on macOS...

## Barely Asked Questions

**Why not SwiftUI?**

It's cool and funny, but I want this tool to be compatible for more systems. It's not that complex to use all those fancy Rx technonogies. We researchers are used to command line interfaces after all.

**What's the difference between this and ObjectiveSee?**

I did it for fun and I don't want to reinvent the wheel. ObjectiveSee is friendly enough for administrators and regular users, while I want this tool to help offensive researchers to discover new bugs by auditing attack surfaces.
